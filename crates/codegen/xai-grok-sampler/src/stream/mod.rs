//! Layer-2 stream transforms: turn raw HTTP chunk streams into [`SamplingEvent`](crate::events::SamplingEvent) streams.
//!
//! Each backend has its own transform because the raw chunk types differ.
//! Dispatch lives in [`actor::request_task`](crate::actor::request_task), which reads `SamplerConfig.api_backend`.
//! It calls the matching `SamplingClient::conversation_stream*` method and hands the raw stream to the transform here.
